Comparison of altGDMin-MRI and altGDMin-MRI2.

To generate Table III and Table V results:

1. Load the .mat files in the Dataset folder (Copy and paste the .mat files in the same folder contating the files).

2.  Run Main_comparison_of_algorithm.m: This run altGDMin-MRI and altGDMin-MRI2 algorithms and calculate NMSE (Normalized Mean Square Error), Time required and Similarity index and save these results in Comparison_error.txt [Error(Time)] amd Comparison_sim.txt [sim(Time)].

The folder "Dataset" contains the MRI used in this paper (except long-speech sequence because of its larger size).
